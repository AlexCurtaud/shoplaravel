# Shop Laravel

## Description
A school project to introduce us to Laravel.

## Goal
The goal here is to create an ecom to unrderstand the different aspects of Laravel and more globally to a Backend Framework
The focus points were :
- Understanding & Use of MVC Model
- Setting up our environnement at the start and as well when we clone the repo from GitHub (.env / vendor etc).
- Database/Migration/Seeder
- The Routes, how to set it up etc...
- Views with Blades, understanding of Layouts and Other type of Blade. How to make them interact with the Model/Class/Controller
- Model and Controller, their use and relationship
- Authentification / Right depending on User status
- And so on.

## Current State
### Minimum feature missing
- Create an order from the cart
- CSS | The focus here was far from the style of my site. It will come next, but the main goal was to make it functional.
### State
**Work in Progress**

## Organisation
MVC Model / Laravel Framework / No Frontend framework or library yet

## Want to use this project ?
You will need at least to :
- copy .env.example into .env and complete it in order to connect to your own database.
- Run the command "composer install"

## Author Note
This project taught me a lot, and going from pure PHP to Laravel was challenging at the begging but it was so satifsying to understand it bit by bit!
Working with MVC Model is now clear, I am not lost anymore when I land in a project with all the folder etc.
Very cool perspective and can't wait to go further

Have a nice day !
